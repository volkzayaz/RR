friend, me and pain are hangin out again\nThey say I need to learn to love myself and then I'll find my way\nBut when it seems there's nothing left it's harder every day\nLove is not my friend, me and pain are hangin out again\nI was wrong to have believed in you\nSometimes I wish I didn't know the truth\nI will get by or so they say\nWhat do they know about it anyway\nLove is not my friend, me and pain are hangin out again\nThey say I need to learn to love myself and then I'll find my way\nBut when it seems there's nothing left it's harder every day\nLove is not my friend, me and pain are hangin out again\nBut it ain’t over, till my heart says its over\nI hear your voice inside my head again\nEmotional breakdown does it ever end\nIa close my eye and I feel your touch\nLike you and illusion that I must give up\nLove is not my friend, me and pain are hangin out again\nThey say I need to learn to love myself and then I'll find my way\nBut when it seems there's nothing left it's harder every day\nLove is not my friend, me and pain are hangin out again\nI was wrong to have believed in you\nSometimes I wish I didn't know the truth\nI will get by or so they say\nWhat do they know about it anyway\nLove is not my friend, me and pain are hangin out again\nThey say I need to learn to love myself and then I'll find my way\nBut when it seems there's nothing left it's harder every day\nLove is not my friend, me and pain are hangin out again\nBut it ain’t over, till my heart says its over\nI hear your voice inside my head again\nEmotional breakdown does it ever end\nIa close my eye and I feel your touch\nLike you and illusion that I must give up\nLove is not my friend, me and pain are hangin out again\nThey say I need to learn to love myself and then I'll find my way\nBut when it seems there's nothing left it's harder every day\nLove is not my friend, me and pain are hangin out again\nI was wrong to have believed in you\nSometimes I wish I didn't know the
